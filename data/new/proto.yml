# # Login Sequence
# The login process is as follows:
#
# C→S: [Login](#packet_login)
# S→C: [Server To Client Handshake](#packet_server_to_client_handshake)
# C→S: [Client To Server Handshake](#packet_client_to_server_handshake)
# S→C: [Play Status (Login success)](#packet_play_status)
# To spawn, the following packets should be sent, in order, after the ones above:
#
# S→C: [Resource Packs Info](#packet_resource_packs_info)
# C→S: [Resource Pack Client Response](#packet_resource_pack_client_response)
# S→C: [Resource Pack Stack](#packet_resource_pack_stack)
# C→S: [Resource Pack Client Response](#packet_resource_pack_client_response)

# S→C: [Creative Content](#packet_creative_content)
# S→C: [Biome Definition List](#packet_biome_definition_list)
# S→C: [Chunks](#packet_level_chunk)
# S→C: [Play Status (Player spawn)](#packet_play_status)
# If there are no resource packs being sent, a Resource Pack Stack can be sent directly
